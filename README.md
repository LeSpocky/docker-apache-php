## Background

The official php Docker image is not suitable for certain use cases as-is.
This enables some Apache modules and PHP extensions not present in the
php-apache Docker image by default.

One goal of this project is to automate the whole build, test, and
release process as far as possible.
Updates on the Docker base image are recognized by Renovate Bot.
All updates except for major PHP updates should automatically trigger a
new release build.

This project follows semantic versioning, although the version numbers
do not correspond with the PHP version this is based on.

## Install

Docker images are built by GitHub CI and pushed to ghcr.io so you can
pull the images like this:

```
docker pull ghcr.io/lespocky/apache-php:latest
```

Semantic versioning like tags are created for release versions.
So you can pull version *1.2.3* or *1.2* or *1* as you like it.

## Usage

If not pulling the distributed image, build it by yourself the usual way:

```
docker build .
```

For further documentation on how to use the image, see
[php Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/php).

## Modules and Extensions

The following Apache modules are enabled additionally:

- rewrite

The following PHP extensions are installed additionally:

- gd
- mysqli
